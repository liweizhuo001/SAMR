SAMR (Semi-Automatic Mmapping Revision) is a graph-based tool for interactive mapping revision. We equip it with partially automatized process to reduce the effort of manual evaluation.

The framework of SAMR is based on AML (AgreementMakerLight) Eclipse Project.

Software: Java 1.7 or higher. Hardware: 4GB RAM or more. 

Data sets: 
Ontologies of Conference Track and alignments of HMatch and ASMOV are provided for your test. The other dataset and alignments could be downloaded in Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/.

Usage:
a)If you install Eclipse, you can import this project directly and run the aml.RepairingByGraph4HMatch.java or aml.RepairingByGraphASMOV.java. You can also manually adjust other methods by function "repairByGraph()" in aml.AML such as One2OneRevisedMappings(),ChristianToolRevisedMappings() and so on.


b)If you want to run the program by command line. you just need finish three steps:
1. use command line to enter the root directory of SAMR project. 
2. Ensure that your tested ontologies have been listed in "Ontologies" file.
3. Run command "java -classpath bin;src/lib/*;ExternalLib/*;  aml.RepairingByGraphcmd conference/ontologies/cmt.owl conference/ontologies/Conference.owl HMatch-cmt-conference.rdf conference/references/cmt-conference.rdf testResult.rdf" in Windows environments.

In linux, this commands ";" need to change ":".

c)In order to provide better interactive services, we also provide a web version, call "SAOR-Web". You can directly download it and follow the its instruction to complete the matching repair. 


The key functions introduction:
aml.Repairingcmd: call SAMR interactive mapping revision. 
aml.RepairingByGraph4HMatch: call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by HMatch . 
aml.RepairingByGraphASMOV: call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by ASMOV. 


Instructions:
For HMatch, it can be downloaded in http://islab.di.unimi.it/hmatch/news.php
For ASMOV, it can be downloaded  in https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=2089&release_id=7571#aroma-_1.2-title-content  
In addition, OAEI provide lots of reference alignments and results generated by mangy matching systems.
