SAMR (Semi-Automatic Mmapping Revision) is a graph-based tool for interactive mapping revision. We equip it with partially automatized process to reduce the effort of manual evaluation.

The framework of SAMR is based on AML (AgreementMakerLight) Eclipse Project.

Software: Java 1.7 or higher. Hardware: 8GB RAM or more. 

Data sets: 
Ontologies of Conference Track, Anatomy Track and Large BioMed Track from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/.

Alignments of HMatch and ASMOV in alignment4Experiment file are provided for Conference Track. 
Alignments of AROMA, FCA-Map, LogMapLite and AML_M are provided for Anatomy Track and Large BioMed Track. You can find them in the directory of testdata/mappings.


Usage:
a)If you install Eclipse, you can import this project directly and run the aml.RepairingByGraph4HMatch.java or aml.RepairingByGraphASMOV.java. You can also manually adjust other methods by function "repairByGraph()" in aml.AML (line 905-927)  such as One2OneRevisedMappings(),ChristianToolRevisedMappings() and so on.


b)If you want to run the program by command line. you just need finish three steps:
1. use command line to enter the root directory of SAMR project. 
2. Ensure that your tested ontologies have been listed in "Ontologies" file.
3. Run command "java -classpath bin;src/lib/*;ExternalLib/*;  aml.RepairingByGraphcmd conference/ontologies/cmt.owl conference/ontologies/Conference.owl HMatch-cmt-conference.rdf conference/references/cmt-conference.rdf testResult.rdf" in Windows environments.

In linux, this commands ";" need to change ":".

c)In order to provide better interactive services, we also provide a web version, call "SAOR-Web". You can directly download it and follow the its instruction to complete the matching repair. 

d)For automated repair by reference alignment, we can run the aml.RepairingByGraphAutoHMatch.java or aml.RepairingByGraphAutoASMOV.java. We also provide optional function about realible mappings in aml.AML (line 911), which can save 10%-35% for alignments generated by large ontologies. Moreover, there exists one varibale about error_user in the method called AutoBasedReferenceAlignmentSimpleAutoGraphRepair, which is used to test automated evaluation with error rate.


The key functions introduction:
aml.Repairingcmd.java: call SAMR interactive mapping revision. 
aml.RepairingByGraph4HMatch.java: call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by HMatch interactively. 
aml.RepairingByGraphASMOV.java: call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by ASMOV interactively. 
aml.RepairingByGraphAutoHMatch.java call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by HMatch automatically. 
aml.RepairingByGraphAutoASMOV.java call SAMR to repair the mappings generated by ASMOV automatically. 

Instructions:
For HMatch, it can be downloaded in http://islab.di.unimi.it/hmatch/news.php
For AROMA, it can be downloaded in https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=2089
For FCA-Map, it can be downloaded in https://github.com/liweizhuo001/FCA-Map
For LogMap, it can be downloaded in https://github.com/ernestojimenezruiz/logmap-matcher
For AML, it can be downloaded in https://github.com/AgreementMakerLight/AML-Project

In addition, OAEI provide lots of reference alignments and results generated by mangy matching systems.
